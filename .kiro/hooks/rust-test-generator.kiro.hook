Create unit tests for all public functions and methods\n3. Create integration tests if appropriate\n4. Add tests for edge cases and error conditions\n5. Ensure tests follow Rust testing conventions\n6. Place tests in appropriate locations (inline #[cfg(test)] modules or separate test files)\n7. Run the tests automatically after creation\n8. Report the test results\n\nFocus on creating meaningful, comprehensive test coverage for the Rust code."
